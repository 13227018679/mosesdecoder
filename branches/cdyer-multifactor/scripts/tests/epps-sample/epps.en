<s> i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on thursday , 28 march 1996 . </s> 
<s> ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the house let me welcome a delegation from the grand committee of the finnish parliament , i.e. , the european affairs committee of the finnish parliament , led by its chairman , mr erkki tuomioja . i bid you a warm welcome ! </s> 
<s> we are pleased at this visit , which reflects the increasingly close cooperation between us and the national parliaments in the union , and i wish our finnish colleagues a pleasant stay in strasbourg and , of course , useful and interesting discussions in this house ! </s> 
<s> the minutes of the sitting of thursday , 28 march 1996 have been distributed . </s> 
<s> are there any comments ? </s> 
<s> mr president , on behalf of my fellow-members from the committee on agriculture i should like to ask you to change a few things in the voting about the bse resolution . obviously one or two things have gone wrong . </s> 
<s> points 16 and 17 now contradict one another whereas the voting showed otherwise . </s> 
<s> i shall be passing on to you some comments which you could perhaps take up with regard to the voting . </s> 
<s> i will have to look into that , mrs oomen-ruijten . </s> 
<s> i cannot say anything at this stage . </s> 
<s> we will consider the matter . </s> 
<s> mr president , it concerns the speech made last week by mr fischler on bse and reported in the minutes . </s> 
<s> perhaps the commission or you could clarify a point for me . it would appear that a speech made at the weekend by mr fischler indicates a change of his position . </s> 
<s> i welcome this change because he has said that he will eat british beef and that the ban was imposed specifically for economic and political reasons . </s> 
<s> could somebody clarify that he has actually said this please , mr president , because it is a change of views . </s> 
<s> mr sturdy , i cannot see what that has to do with the minutes . </s> 
<s> mr president , on exactly the same point as mr sturdy has raised . </s> 
<s> if commission fischler has made this statement , then he has said that it is not a matter of public health . </s> 
<s> if it is not a matter of public health , he has no legal base , if he has no legal base then he may very well face legal action from the people his statement has damaged . </s> 
<s> mr smith , the same applies to your point ; it has nothing to do with the minutes . </s> 
<s> mr president , again on bse . if mr fischler has changed his views does this mean the commission has ? </s> 
<s> this was actually referred to in the minutes . </s> 
<s> he said that any funding would also go towards supporting workers who had directly lost their jobs . </s> 
<s> so far nothing has come of this in any scheme that has been put forward . </s> 
<s> does this mean the commission has changed its view on supporting workers who have lost their jobs through this scare ? </s> 
<s> i note that there are no comments on the minutes . </s> 
<s> ( parliament approved the minutes ) </s> 
<s> mr president , since our last meeting in strasbourg there was a report from the news agency afp on 26 march that thirteen irregularly employed workers were identified in a police blitz on the building site of our new hemicycle . </s> 
<s> eight of these workers were undeclared and five others were citizens of one member state employed by a building contractor in another member state who were drawing unemployment benefit in france . </s> 
<s> now that is clearly a fraud on the french taxpayer as well as a fraud on the european citizens . </s> 
<s> can we ask the bureau to look into this fact . </s> 
<s> when the european parliament , that so frequently insists on workers' rights and proper social protection , is building a hemicycle , it should make sure that the contracts concerning those employed in the buildings should provide for full social protection and full payment . </s> 
<s> can we ask you as president to make sure that is happening with the taxpayers' money for which we are collectively responsible . </s> 
<s> mr tomlinson , would you please give me the documents concerned . </s> 
<s> then i will look into the matter , both in the presidency and with the other organizations in question . </s> 
<s> you yourself know best how difficult and complicated the legal situation is between parliament and the firms contracted to build the hemicycle . </s> 
<s> after all , we have in you an expert who is in any case closely concerned with these matters . </s> 
<s> mr president , i should like to deal very briefly with two matters . </s> 
<s> first , since we condemned at the time eta's terrorist murders and kidnappings , today we can give you the news that the hostage who beats all records in spain - almost a year's captivity , 342 days , - has been freed , not , it is true , by the forces of public order , but he is at liberty . </s> 
<s> and i should be very pleased - and so , i think , would all members , particularly the spanish members and perhaps still more those who are distinguished by being spanish basques - if you would send a message to the hostage's family to congratulate them on his freedom . </s> 
<s> secondly i should like to point out , before the agenda is settled , that the importance of the bombardment of lebanese territory by the state of israel will make it necessary to ask for a statement from the council . </s> 
<s> these indiscriminate and unfair bombardments not only infringe human rights but may also pose a threat to the independence and integrity of the state of lebanon , which is guaranteed by international law and by resolution 245 of the united nations security council . </s> 
<s> thank you ! </s> 
<s> the next item is the order of business . </s> 
<s> the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the conference of presidents at its meeting of 11 april 1996 pursuant to rule 95 of the rules of procedure has been distributed . no amendments have been proposed . </s> 
<s> mr president , i should like to ask a question . </s> 
<s> we were too late to hand it in , but it has been discussed with a number of members . </s> 
<s> it is the following . </s> 
<s> i think that in view of present events in the middle east , we ought to ask whether the council can make a statement on wednesday afternoon about the way things are going . we note that the situation is changing every day . </s> 
<s> we see that the french government has sent a mediator . </s> 
<s> we hear nothing from the presidency . </s> 
<s> nor have we heard anything , unfortunately , from the commission . </s> 
<s> that is reason enough for us to be put in the picture . </s> 
<s> i should like to ask you to see whether it is possible for the italian presidency to do that on wednesday afternoon . </s> 
<s> we recognize that the agenda is very full . </s> 
<s> i might suggest that , at least as far as the epp group is concerned , we could perhaps take this question up on wednesday afternoon and then omit the chernobyl question , otherwise i think we shall not get through . </s> 
<s> then we could deal with chernobyl some time later . </s> 
<s> i offer that as a suggestion , mr president . </s> 
<s> if you would like to arrange things some other way so that we do not need to take chernobyl off the agenda that would suit us just as well . </s> 
<s> mr president , my group is certainly of the view that what is happening in the middle east is very significant and that we cannot let this week with parliament in full session pass without any response or discussion . </s> 
<s> could we leave it to you , mr president , to see whether the council is prepared to make a statement on the middle east and what is happening in the lebanon ? </s> 
<s> could we then look to you to see what is possible . </s> 
<s> i am reluctant , as i know many of my colleagues are , to remove chernobyl from the agenda , as suggested by mrs oomen-ruijten . </s> 
<s> however , it would be possible for us to come back to the issue of chernobyl which does not have such immediacy although it is the tenth anniversary . </s> 
<s> we could take this in two weeks' time , whereas the issue of lebanon is crucial at this moment . </s> 
<s> perhaps , mr president , we could ask you to look at this with the council and see what would be possible . </s> 
<s> mr president , i am glad to support mrs oomen-ruijten's suggestion , supported by mrs green - with one slight reservation . </s> 
<s> i think that as a matter of courtesy we should naturally ask the council whether it is ready to make a statement . </s> 
<s> but politically i am not concerned about a question of courtesy ; i am concerned about asking the council presidency to come here to explain why it not playing any part in this crisis either . </s> 
<s> i understand the french government's motives for trying to mediate . </s> 
<s> i hope the council has taken the decision that mr herv√© de charette should try to mediate on behalf of the union , but all the indications are that it has not and that the french government is working independently here . </s> 
<s> that is no problem for me ; i think it is a good initiative , but again europe is absent . </s> 
<s> that was previously the case in the crisis between turkey and greece , and then mr holbrooke rightly said : ' europe is sleeping through the night' . </s> 
<s> it should not happen again , mr president . </s> 
<s> my group wants the italian presidency to come here and explain what its role is . </s> 
<s> mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i think it is important that we should discuss the situation in the middle east this week . </s> 
<s> we all agree on that . </s> 
<s> but i think it is equally important that we discuss chernobyl this week . </s> 
<s> i cannot support this proposal . </s> 
<s> the whole world is talking about the tenth anniversary . </s> 
<s> a major conference was held in vienna . </s> 
<s> there was a tribunal . </s> 
<s> and then we say we will postpone it to whenever . </s> 
<s> i really think it would show parliament in a poor light if we do not discuss it on wednesday . </s> 
<s> we must not turn it into a competition between chernobyl and the proposal to ask the council to report on the situation in the middle east this week and to debate on it , and then put chernobyl in second place ! </s> 
<s> there are various other options . </s> 
<s> we can listen to the council on the subject on wednesday morning , but please not just in a week's time . </s> 
<s> at a time when the whole world is discussing chernobyl and the effects of that disaster , we in this parliament cannot say , we shall hold back and say nothing about it ! </s> 
<s> mr president , i have already given you the reasons why the council should make a statement about the bombardment of lebanon . </s> 
<s> in discussing the euro-mediterranean conference , to which we gave the greatest prominence , we cannot then wash our hands of it and leave it to the european powers to take diplomatic steps in the middle east outside the necessary agreement within the union . </s> 
<s> that would be a bad sign for the intergovernmental conference and for the future of the european union . </s> 
<s> but i think , like mrs roth , that we cannot make the subject of chernobyl and the subject of the middle east compete in the 'free market for news items' . </s> 
<s> we must seek out the opportunity to discuss both subjects . </s> 
<s> mr president , like previous colleagues , i believe it to be absolutely essential that the council make a statement on wednesday about the middle east situation , particularly in southern lebanon . </s> 
<s> what is happening there is worrying and distressing because the whole peace process that has been under way for several months could be threatened . </s> 
<s> and the most important task is to stop the fighting and give priority to diplomatic moves , wherever they come from , provided they finally lead to the silencing of the rockets and guns and some real progress towards peace and stability in the region . </s> 
<s> we should also remember lebanon itself , which has been ravaged for many years , under the domination of one foreign power while part of its territory is occupied by another . </s> 
<s> so it is surely our duty to make a statement on the subject : we are witnessing events which , i am convinced , should persuade us to find a slot in wednesday's agenda for such a statement and the subsequent debate . </s> 
<s> ladies and gentlemen , this is one of the cases where there is no satisfactory solution because someone is bound to be disappointed and any decision is bound to be to the detriment of someone's interests . </s> 
<s> let me describe the situation to you as i see it . </s>
