0) Preliminaries

Before building you need to decide what language model toolkit (SRI's
or IRST's) you want to use.

If you want to use SRI's, you will need to download its source 
and build it.  The SRILM can be downloaded from 
http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/download.html .


If you want to use IRST's, you will need to download its source
and build it.  The IRSTLM can be downloaded from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/irstlm/

IMPORTANT: These instructions are for building the moses decoder ONLY,
the training and tuning SCRIPTS contained in scripts/ must be built
and installed separately.  Also, they may require modification to
work in certain environments.

Versions 1.9 (or higher) of aclocal and automake are required.

For Mac OSX users:
Standard distribution usually includes versions 1.6.
Get correct versions, and set the environment variables ACLOCAL and 
AUTOMAKE to the correct paths in ./regenerate-makefiles.sh.

1) Instructions for building with SRILM

Build SRILM according to their release instructions.  Make sure that
you DO NOT override the MACHINE_TYPE variable on the command line when
you do so, as this can lead to problems locating the library.

 ./regenerate-makefiles.sh
 ./configure --with-srilm=/path/to/srilm

The resulting decoder binary will be moses-cmd/src/moses .

2) Instructions for building with IRSTLM

Build IRSTLM according to its release instructions.  Make sure that
you DO NOT override the MACHINE_TYPE variable on the command line when
you do so, as this can lead to problems locating the library.

 ./regenerate-makefiles.sh
 ./configure --with-irstlm=/path/to/irstlm

The resulting decoder binary will be moses-cmd/src/moses .
