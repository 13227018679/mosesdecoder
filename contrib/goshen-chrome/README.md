# goshen

Goshen is a Chrome extension that duplicates the utility of the Google Translate chrome extension for on-page website translation, using the Goshen JavaScript library with Moses as a backend translator. (It also has the ability to swap in an arbitrary translation engine, if the appropriate adapters are written.)
