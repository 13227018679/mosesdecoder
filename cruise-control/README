A simple regular testing of Moses codebase, aka cruise control
Started by Ondrej Bojar

Usage:

1. Checkout this directory somewhere on the computer where you want to run the
   cruise control.
2. Create as many config files as you wish, an example is ondrej-nb.config
   ...hardcode all paths to you preferred external tools like LM toolkits.
3. Run ./test_all_new_commits.sh <CONFIGFILE>



TODO / KNOWN BUGS
- regression tests are not run yet

- regression tests always require SRILM, but we need to test all LMs that have
  been compiled in
  => add separate regression tests, one for each LM?
  => modify regression tests to actually loop over all LMs?

- final status is FAIL if any regression test fails, but we should actually
  allow to expect failures for the given set of ./configure parameters
  (e.g. regression test requiring irstlm is bound to fail if we're not linking
  against irstlm)
