LANGUAGE MODEL:
Currently, only SRILM is supported by our code.
You will need to download its source 
and build it.  The SRILM can be downloaded from 
http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/download.html .

Of course, since all language model files are in arpa-format you
can train a KenLM and specify it as a SRILM...
(a) while training a model:
--lm 0:5:/path/to/lm.arpa:0

(b) in the moses.ini:
[lmodel-file]
0 0 5 /path/to/lm.arpa

BOOST:
Version 1.35 or higher is required.

ACLOCAL / AUTOMAKE:
Versions 1.14 (or higher) are required.

1) Instructions for building with SRILM

Build SRILM according to their release instructions.  Make sure that
you DO NOT override the MACHINE_TYPE variable on the command line when
you do so, as this can lead to problems locating the library.

 ./regenerate-makefiles.sh
 ./configure --with-srilm=/path/to/srilm --enable-threads [--with-boost=/path/to/non-standard/boost]
 ./make -j numavail
 
The resulting decoder binary for MBOT  will be moses-chard-cmd/src/moses_chart .
