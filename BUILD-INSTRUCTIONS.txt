PRELIMINARIES

Moses is primarily targeted at gcc on UNIX.  

Moses requires gcc, Boost >= 1.36, and zlib including the headers that some
distributions package separately.  Most distributions package Boost but source
can also be downloaded from http://www.boost.org/.  

There are several optional dependencies:

GIZA++ from http://code.google.com/p/giza-pp/ is used to build phrase tables.

The scripts support building ARPA format language models with SRILM or IRSTLM.
To apply models inside the decoder, you can use SRILM, IRSTLM, or KenLM.  The
ARPA format is exchangable so that e.g. you can build a model with SRILM and
run the decoder with IRSTLM or KenLM.

If you want to use SRILM, you will need to download its source and build it.  
The SRILM can be downloaded from 
http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/download.html .
On x86_64, the default machine type is broken.  Edit sbin/machine-type, find
this code
    else if (`uname -m` == x86_64) then
        set MACHINE_TYPE = i686
and change it to
    else if (`uname -m` == x86_64) then
        set MACHINE_TYPE = i686-m64
You may have to chmod +w sbin/machine-type first.  

If you want to use IRSTLM, you will need to download its source and build it.  
The IRSTLM can be downloaded from either the SourceForge website
http://sourceforge.net/projects/irstlm
or the official IRSTLM website
http://hlt.fbk.eu/en/irstlm

KenLM is included with Moses.

BUILDING

Building consists of running
  ./bjam [options]

Common options are:
--with-srilm=/path/to/srilm to compile the decoder with SRILM support
--with-irstlm=/path/to/irstlm to compile the decoder with IRSTLM support
--with-giza=/path/to/giza to enable training scripts
-jN where N is the number of CPUs

Binaries will appear in dist/bin.  

For further documentation, run 
  ./bjam --help

ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO BUILD ON UNIX AND OTHER PLATFORMS

Microsoft Windows
-----------------
Moses is primarily targeted at gcc on UNIX.  Windows users should consult
http://ssli.ee.washington.edu/people/amittai/Moses-on-Win7.pdf .  

Binaries for all external libraries needed can be downloaded from 
	http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=Moses.LibrariesUsed

Only the decoder is developed and tested under Windows. There are difficulties
using the training scripts under Windows, even with Cygwin.
