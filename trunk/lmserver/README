This software is based on pieces of the memcached server.

The following was taken from their README:

Dependencies:

   -- libevent, http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/ (libevent-dev)

If using Linux, you need a kernel with epoll.  Sure, libevent will
work with normal select, but it sucks.

epoll isn't in Linux 2.4 yet, but there's a backport at:

    http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/nio-improve.html
     
You want the epoll-lt patch (level-triggered).

If you're using MacOS, you'll want libevent 1.1 or higher to deal with 
a kqueue bug.
